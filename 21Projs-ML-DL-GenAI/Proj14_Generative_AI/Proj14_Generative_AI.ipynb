Generative AI\n","Building Your Own Custom GPT Engine\n","\n","# Project 14: Tiny LLM Story Generator — Training Notebook\n","\n","**Purpose:** This notebook trains a compact GPT-2 style language model to generate short children’s stories using the **TinyStories** dataset. It covers data loading, tokenization, model configuration, custom training, checkpointing, and sampling from saved checkpoints.\n","\n","## What this notebook does\n","1. **Setup (Colab + Dependencies):** Mount Google Drive for persistent storage and import core libraries (`transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`, etc.).  \n","2. **Data:** Load `roneneldan/TinyStories` via Hugging Face Datasets and perform lightweight preprocessing/tokenization suitable for small-context language modeling.  \n","3. **Model:** Initialize a small GPT-2 configuration (tokenizer + `GPT2LMHeadModel`) tailored for fast prototyping on limited resources.  \n","4. **Training Loop:** Train with `AdamW`, gradient clipping, and mini-batches using `DataLoader`/`IterableDataset`; track loss and save periodic checkpoints.  \n","5. **Logging & Plots:** Record training history (e.g., loss) and visualize progression to validate convergence.  \n","6. **Checkpointing:** Persist tokenizer/model to Drive for later reuse and reproducibility.  \n","7. **Inference:** Load a chosen checkpoint and generate stories to qualitatively evaluate results.\n","\n","## Why TinyStories?\n","TinyStories is a curated corpus of short, simple narratives designed for training and evaluating small language models. It enables rapid experiments while demonstrating end-to-end LM training and text generation.\n","\n","## Requirements\n","- Python 3.x, PyTorch, Transformers, Datasets, TQDM, Matplotlib  \n","- Sufficient GPU (e.g., Colab T4/A100) recommended\n","\n","## Reproducibility & Tips\n","- Fix random seeds for consistent runs.  \n","- Start with a small context length and batch size; scale up gradually.  \n","- Monitor loss curves; stop early if overfitting.  \n","- Keep checkpoints versioned (e.g., `tinygpt2_epochN`).\n","\n","> **Reference Dataset:** `roneneldan/TinyStories` (Hugging Face Datasets).  \n","> **Author:** Ashish (Data Science Mentor) — YYYY-MM-DD.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"twUL4J3zk7Zk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.
