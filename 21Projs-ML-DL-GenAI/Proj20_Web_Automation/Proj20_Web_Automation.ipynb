A developer writes a script with explicit, step-by-step instructions for the browser to follow. For example, a command might be, \"find an element using its specific XPath or CSS selector,\" followed by another command to \"click on it\" or \"type into it.\"\n","\n","The fundamental weakness of this method is its brittleness. Websites are dynamic; their underlying code structure, the Document Object Model (DOM), is frequently updated by developers. Even a minor code change, like altering an element's ID or adjusting the page layout, can cause the script's selector to fail.\n","\n","Once a selector breaks, the script cannot find its target element, and the entire automated process grinds to a halt. This creates a high maintenance burden, as scripts must be constantly fixed to keep up with website updates."],"metadata":{"id":"CydC02-rpf3t"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["What if you could give a brain to your browser?"],"metadata":{"id":"XIInBCL1o9Qn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Browser Agents**"],"metadata":{"id":"8c2PPsZMpCyh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["An AI browser agent is a software program enhanced with artificial intelligence that can perform web-based tasks autonomously, much like a human user would. These agents operate within a web browser, using LLMs, and computer vision to interact with websites in a way that mimics human behavior.\n","\n","Instead of following a rigid, pre-written script like traditional automation tools, an AI browser agent is given a high-level goal in natural language, such as \"Find the top tech articles today\" or \"Book the cheapest flight to New York\". The agent then independently plans and executes the steps needed to achieve that goal.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4Igkp9ZFq9Lq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **How AI Browser Agents Work**\n","\n","An AI browser agent's architecture allows it to perceive, reason, and act within a web environment:\n","*   **Perception (The \"Eyes\")** The agent \"sees\" a webpage using a combination of methods. It analyzes the structural data, like the HTML or Document Object Model (DOM), to understand the page's layout and identify interactive elements. It also uses computer vision to analyze screenshots, allowing it to identify elements based on their appearance, just as a person would. This dual approach makes it more resilient to website changes.\n","\n","*   **Reasoning (The \"Brain\")** At its core is a Large Language Model (LLM), like GPT-4, which acts as the decision-making engine. The LLM interprets the user's goal, analyzes the data from the perception layer, and breaks the task down into a sequence of actions.\n","\n","*   **Actuation (The \"Hands\")** To perform actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling, the agent uses an underlying browser automation framework, such as Playwright or Selenium. The LLM decides *what* to do, and the framework executes *how* to do it.\n","\n","This process repeats in an \"observe-decide-act\" loop until the task is complete.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"O8dLv23Ast2_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Key Capabilities and Use Cases**\n","\n","AI browser agents are designed to handle dynamic and complex web interactions. Their primary functions include:\n","*   **Web Scraping and Data Extraction** They can navigate multiple pages to extract and structure information, such as product details or contact lists.\n","*   **Form Filling and Submission** Agents can intelligently fill out complex forms for tasks like signing up for services, applying for jobs, or getting insurance quotes.\n","*   **Cross-Application Workflows** They can automate tasks that span multiple websites, such as taking a new follower from LinkedIn and adding them as a lead in Salesforce.\n","*   **Complex Research** An agent can be tasked with open-ended research, like reading a CV, finding relevant jobs online, and saving them to a file."],"metadata":{"id":"gEuxaNAjsxOo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## DON'T TRY TO RUN BROWSER-USE IN GOOGLE COLAB"],"metadata":{"id":"gQTCb5HRqGgM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Installation\n","\n","```python\n","pip install playwright && playwright install chromium --with-deps\n","pip install browser-use\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"yXPytencySeX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Setup your LLM\n","\n","Create a .env file and add your API key.
